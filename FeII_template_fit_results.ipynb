    "# FeII template subtraction - effect on fitting the $H_{\\beta}$, $O III$ region\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will show the reults of fitting the continuum emission combined with an FeII emission template, and subtracting it from the spectra, before stacking and fitting to find the $H_{\\beta}$, $O III$ properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting point:\n",
    "* In what we did so far, the continuum was fitted with a straight line between the median flux values at the two following regions: 4190â€“4215A, 5090- 5110A\n",
    "* The spectra was stacked according to the width of the $H_{\\beta}$ line (how this is done is a seprate issue so we won't discuss it here)\n",
    "* The stacked spectra was fitted in different ways, this is because there are a few components in the $H_{\\beta}$, $O III$ region that there is no correct way (that we know of) to fit. These are:\n",
    "    1. The assymetric shape of the $H_{\\beta}$ line\n",
    "    2. Excess emission in the $O III$ region. Now that we started looking into the FeII emission we know that this emission is FeII. We also now know that there is an additional FeII line between $H_{\\beta}$ and $O III$. When we did the fitting we did not take this into account and the FeII was included in the $O III$ broad line component. This is not great, espcially because this breakes the theoretical relations between the two  $O III$ lines. <br>\n",

The doppler velocity and the offset are the same for all the FeII components. We take the wavelength range of 4000-5500A, and exlude the $H_{\\beta}$, $O III$ region, and other non-FeII emission regions. We fit a power-law for the continuum and use the templates to fit the FeII emission (this is done for each object separetly, i.e, not for the stacked spectra).\n",
